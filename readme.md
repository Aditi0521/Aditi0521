Aim of this project is to create a doctor appointment booking system that will help doctors in their work and will also help patients to book doctor appointments and reports. The system allows doctors to manage their booking slots online. Patients are allowed to book empty slots online and those slots are reserved in their name. The system manages the appointment data for multiple doctors of various date and
times. Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical entry is stored in the database by the doctor. Next time a user logs in he/she may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view a patient's previous medical history while the patient visits him.
